# Dotfiles

Here is the collection of my dotfiles. I do my best to keep them clean and up
to date, but these are constantly changing as I update my dev environment and
shell custimizations so they are bound to be a bit inconsistent from time to
time. O well...

## Key Features

- Zsh - I use the Z shell along with
  [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). I recently switched
from bash, so I expect my shell related customizations will increase very soon.

- Vim - Vim is my editor and I am a huge fan of it. I end up spending equal
  time in shell vim while doing things in the terminal, and using MacVim for
more focussed or extended development. I use
[pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) along with the
[vim-update-bundle](https://github.com/bronson/vim-update-bundles) ruby script
to mangage installing and removing plugins.

- Git - Git for version control, obviously. I originally used mercurial back
  when I was working in python more, but once I tried git, there was no going
back.
